"""Typed state threaded through the reasoning graph.

One ReasoningState instance flows from Observe to Notify; each node reads the fields it
needs and writes the fields it produces. Keeping it a dataclass (not free-form dict) makes
every node's contract explicit and lets the nodes be unit-tested in isolation.
