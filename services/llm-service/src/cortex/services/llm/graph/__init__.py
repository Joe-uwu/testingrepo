"""LangGraph-style reasoning pipeline for llm-service.

The reasoning stage is a typed state graph, not a single prompt→answer call:

    Observe → Retrieve → Verify → GraphTraverse → Reason → Ground → Explain → Recommend → Notify

Each node is a pure, independently-callable function over a typed ReasoningState; the engine
runs them with per-node retry and records a trace. GraphReasoner adapts the pipeline to the
Reasoner protocol so it drops into the existing worker. A real LangGraph/LLM backend can
replace the node bodies without changing the graph shape.
